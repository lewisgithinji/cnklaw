Employment law in Kenya is primarily governed by the **Employment Act, 2007**, which establishes the rights and obligations of both employers and employees. Understanding these legal frameworks is essential for maintaining compliant and harmonious workplace relationships.

> "The Employment Act is the cornerstone of industrial harmony in Kenya, balancing the dynamic needs of business with the fundamental rights of the workforce."

## Strategic Framework of Kenyan Labor Law
The Kenyan labor landscape is highly protected, with significant judicial emphasis on industrial fairness. Employers must navigate these statutes with precision to avoid costly litigation.

### 1. Employment Contracts
**All employment relationships in Kenya must be formalized through written contracts.** 
- **Clarity of Terms**: Contracts should clearly outline job descriptions, remuneration, working hours, and termination procedures.
- **Written Particulars**: Employers are required to provide employees with written particulars within two months of commencement.

### 2. Working Hours and Overtime
**Standard working hours in Kenya are capped at 45-52 hours per week depending on the industry.** 
- **Overtime Pay**: Any work beyond these hours constitutes overtime and must be compensated at a rate of at least 1.5 times the normal hourly wage.
- **Rest Days**: Employees are entitled to at least one full day of rest per week.

### 3. Leave Entitlements
Employees are entitled to several statutory leave categories:
- **Annual Leave**: Not less than 21 working days per year with full pay.
- **Sick Leave**: Provision for sick leave with full and half pay for specified periods.
- **Maternity & Paternity**: Three months for mothers and 14 days for fathers.

### 4. Termination of Employment
**Termination must follow strict 'procedural' and 'substantive' fairness.** 
- **Valid Grounds**: Termination must be based on misconduct, poor performance, or operational requirements (redundancy).
- **Procedural Justice**: The right to be heard and the right to representation during disciplinary hearings.
- **Severance**: Redundancy requires severance pay of at least 15 days' pay for each completed year of service.
