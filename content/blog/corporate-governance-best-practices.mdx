Good corporate governance has moved beyond being a mere "compliance checkbox" for Kenyan firms. In today's globalized economy, it has become a fundamental driver of enterprise value and stakeholder trust.

> "True corporate governance is not about following rules—it is about establishing a culture of accountability that survives any single leadership cycle."

## The Evolving Landscape
The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has established clear guidelines for listed companies, but we are seeing these practices increasingly adopted by private enterprises aiming for regional expansion or international partnership.

Effective corporate governance rests on several key principles:

### 1. Board Composition and Structure
**A well-constituted board should include a balanced mix of executive and non-executive directors**, with at least one-third being independent directors. The board should have clearly defined roles and responsibilities, with appropriate delegation to management while maintaining oversight.

### 2. Transparency and Disclosure
Companies must maintain high standards of transparency in their operations and communications. This includes:
- **Regular financial reporting** in accordance with international accounting standards.
- **Disclosure of material information** to shareholders and stakeholders.
- **Clear communication** of corporate strategy and performance metrics.
- **Transparent reporting** on executive compensation and perks.

### 3. Accountability and Compliance
Directors have fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. Key obligations include:
- **Duty of care and skill** in high-stakes decision-making.
- **Duty to avoid conflicts of interest** and personal gain.
- **Compliance with statutory requirements** under the Companies Act 2015.
- **Maintaining proper books** of account and accessible records.

### 4. Shareholder Rights and Protection
Corporate governance frameworks must protect shareholder rights, including:
- **Right to participate** in general meetings and voting.
- **Right to receive dividends** when declared by the board.
- **Access to company information** and structural records.
- **Protection of minority interests** from majority oppression.

### 5. Risk Management and Internal Controls
Robust risk management systems are essential for good governance. Boards should:
- **Identify and assess** key business and operational risks.
- **Implement internal controls** to mitigate identified risks.
- **Establish audit committees** for independent oversight.
- **Review and update** risk management frameworks on a quarterly basis.

### 6. Regulatory Compliance
Kenyan companies must comply with various regulatory requirements, including:
- **Filing annual returns** with the Registrar of Companies.
- **Holding annual general meetings** (AGMs) within statutory timelines.
- **Maintaining statutory registers** of members and beneficial owners.
- **Adhering to tax obligations** and sector-specific regulations.
