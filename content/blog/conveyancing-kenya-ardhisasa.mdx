The Kenyan land registration landscape has undergone a radical transformation with the introduction of the **Ardhisasa** digital platform and the **Sectional Properties Act 2020**. For property owners and developers, understanding these changes is critical to ensuring secure property titles.

> "Ardhisasa represents more than just a digital portal—it is a fundamental shift toward a transparent, efficient, and secure property market in Kenya."

## The Digital Frontier: Ardhisasa
The Ministry of Lands has moved toward a completely paperless system. This shift marks a significant milestone in reducing fraud and improving the speed of transactions within the Kenyan jurisdiction.

### 1. The Shift to Ardhisasa
**All property transactions must now be initiated through the digital portal.** This includes:
- **Searches and Verifications**: Instant digital searches for property records.
- **Transfers of Title**: Digital submission and tracking of transfer documents.
- **Legal Charges and Mortgages**: Seamless registration of bank charges and liens.
- **Navigating the Portal**: Requires a verified user account, digital signatures, and precise geolocation data.

### 2. Conversions under the Land Registration Act
Old titles registered under the RLA (Registered Land Act) and RDA (Registration of Documents Act) are currently being converted to a unified system under the **Land Registration Act (LRA)**. 
- **Verifying Parcel Numbers**: Owners must be vigilant in verifying their new parcel numbers during this conversion phase.
- **Notice of Conversion**: The government publishes gazette notices regularly; owners should cross-reference their properties against these lists.

### 3. Sectional Properties Act Updates
The 2020 Act requires all long-term leases for apartments and offices to be converted into **Sectional Titles**. 
- **Individual Title Deeds**: This grants individual owners actual title deeds rather than just lease certificates.
- **Bankability**: Sectional titles significantly improve the bankability and market value of apartment units.
- **Compliance Timeline**: Developers and management companies are under a statutory mandate to facilitate these conversions.
