Since the enactment of the **Companies Act, 2015**, the regulatory burden on Kenyan companies has become more structured yet demanding. Compliance is no longer a choice but a pillar of corporate survival.

> "A compliant company is a resilient company. In the face of increasing regulatory oversight, transparency is your greatest competitive advantage."

## The Pillars of Compliance
The Registrar of Companies has tightened enforcement on various statutory disclosures. Failing to meet these requirements can lead to administrative fines, director disqualification, and reputational damage.

### 1. Beneficial Ownership Disclosure
One of the most significant recent updates is the requirement to disclose **Beneficial Owners** to the Registrar of Companies. 
- **Transparency**: Highlighting individuals who exercise ultimate control over the legal entity.
- **Reporting**: Failure to maintain an up-to-date Beneficial Ownership register can lead to heavy fines and restrictions on corporate actions.

### 2. Annual Returns and Filing
**Every company must file an Annual Return within 30 days of the anniversary of its incorporation.** 
- **Corporate Snapshot**: This return provides an updated record of the company's directors, shareholders, and registered office.
- **Regulatory Standing**: Consistent filing is essential for maintaining a "Good Standing" certificate, often required for tenders and banking facilities.

### 3. Data Protection Act Compliance
If your company handles personal data, you are now required to register as a **Data Controller or Data Processor** with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC).
- **Privacy Protections**: Implementing technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.
- **Breach Notification**: Rigid timelines for reporting any data security incidents.

### 4. Occupational Health and Safety (OHSA)
Compliance with workplace safety standards is mandatory for all industrial and commercial workplaces.
- **Wiba Insurance**: Ensuring adequate cover for employee workplace injuries.
- **Safety Audits**: Regular inspections by accredited government auditors.
